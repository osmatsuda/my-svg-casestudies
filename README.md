# My SVG casestudies

https://osmatsuda.github.io/my-svg-casestudies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation

I love SVG. I wish SVG would be more used. However, the specification of SVG is huge. And there are more differences in browser implementations rather than HTML or CSS. So this project is my studies of SVG representation.

## Future Considerations

- Add works each of them is focused one SVG feature
- Add documents for each work
